## Day 1: Introduction to Terraform and Terraform Basics

### What is Terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code?
### Ans:- 
         Terraform is IAAC ( Infrastructure As A Code ) tool which used to build and change infrastructure.
         
         It helps us to manage infrastructure as code in following ways:
         1) Scope - Identify the infrastructure for your project.
         2) Author - Write the configuration for your infrastructure.
         3) Initialize - Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure.
         4) Plan - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.
         5) Apply - Make the planned changes.
  

### Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?
### Ans:-
         Terraform helps to autmomate the infrastructure with the help of terraform configuration files. It reduces 
         i) cost
         ii) human errors etc.
         
         It makes infrastructure provisioning Simple and Fast. 
         With a simple configuartion file we can manage multiple projects.
         Terraform increses speed of creating infrastructure, automation. 
         
         
### How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?
### Ans:-
         
         
         
### Explain the important terminologies of Terraform with the example at least (5 crucial terminologies).
### Ans:-
