# TerraWeek Day 2

## Task 1: Familiarize yourself with HCL syntax used in Terraform
### Learn about HCL blocks, parameters, and arguments
### Ans:-
         1) Blocks 
          - We can write actual configuration code in between blocks only. 
            We can create block by using {}.
            
          Syntax:
                 <block_name> <resource_type> <resource_name> {
                 
                 }
          Example:
                 resource "local_file" "file1"{
                      filename = "/home/ubuntu/file1.txt"
                      content = "I am a devops engineer"
                 }
          
         2) Arguments:
          - Anything written inside the block is called as arguments.
          
          Syntax:
                 <block_name> <resource_type> <resource_name> {
                              <argument1> = ""
                              <argument2> = ""
                 }
          Example:
                 resource "local_file" "file1"{
                      filename = "/home/ubuntu/file1.txt"
                      content = "I am a devops engineer"
                 }
                 
- Explore the different types of resources and data sources available in Terraform

## Task 2: Understand variables, data types, and expressions in HCL
- Create a variables.tf file and define a variable
- Use the variable in a main.tf file to create a "local_file" resource

## Task 3: Practice writing Terraform configurations using HCL syntax
- Add required_providers to your configuration, such as Docker or AWS
- Test your configuration using the Terraform CLI and make any necessary adjustments
